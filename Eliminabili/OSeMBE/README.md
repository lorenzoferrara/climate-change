## The Open Source energy Model Base for the European Union (OSeMBE)

An Energy model base for the European Union developed using the **OSeMOSYS** Modelling Framework.
The model provides country-detailed representation of the 28 European Union (EU) Member States + Switzerland and Norway. The model aims at being used as a multi-regional stakeholders engagement model at the European level.
The development was funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 691739.
