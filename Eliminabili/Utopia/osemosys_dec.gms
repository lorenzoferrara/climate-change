* SETS       
*------------------------------------------------------------------------

* YEAR / y: It represents the time frame of the model, it contains all the
* years to be considered in the study.
set YEAR;
alias (y,yy,yyy,YEAR);

* TECHNOLOGY / t: It includes any element of the energy system that
* changes a commodity from one form to another, uses it or supplies
* it. All system components are set up as a ‘technology’ in OSeMOSYS. As
* the model is an abstraction, the modeller is free to interpret the role
* of a technology at will, where relevant. It may for example represent a
* single real technology (such as a power plant) or can represent a
* heavily aggregated collection of technologies (such as the stock of
* several million light bulbs), or may even simply be a ‘dummy
* technology’, perhaps used for accounting purposes.
set TECHNOLOGY;
alias (t,TECHNOLOGY)

* TIMESLICE / l: It represents the time split of each modelled year,
* therefore the time resolution of the model. Common to several energy
* systems modelling tools (incl. MESSAGE / MARKAL / TIMES), the annual
* demand is ‘sliced’ into representative fractions of the year. It is
* necessary to assess times of the year when demand is high separately
* from times when demand is low, for fuels that are expensive to store. In
* order to reduce the computation time, these ‘slices’ are often
* grouped. Thus, the annual demand may be split into aggregate seasons
* where demand levels are similar (such as ‘summer, winter and
* intermediate’). Those seasons may be subdivided into aggregate ‘day
* types’ (such as workdays and weekends), and the day further sub divided
* (such as into day and night) depending on the level of demand.
set TIMESLICE;
alias (l,TIMESLICE);

* FUEL / f: It includes any energy vector, energy service or proxies
* entering or exiting technologies. These can be aggregate groups,
* individual flows or artificially separated, depending on the
* requirements of the analysis.
set FUEL;
alias (f,FUEL);

* EMISSION / e: It includes any kind of emission potentially deriving from
* the operation of the defined technologies. Typical examples would
* include atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gasses, such as CO2.
set EMISSION;
alias (e,EMISSION);

* MODE_OF_OPERATION / m: It defines the number of modes of operation that
* the technologies can have. If a technology can have various input or
* output fuels and it can choose the mix (i.e.  any linear combination) of
* these input or output fuels, each mix can be accounted as a separate
* mode of operation. For example, a CHP plant may produce heat in one mode
* of operation and electricity in another.
set MODE_OF_OPERATION;
alias (m,MODE_OF_OPERATION);

* REGION / r: It sets the regions to be modelled, e.g. different
* countries. For each of them, the supply-demand balances for all the
* energy vectors are ensured, including trades with other regions. In some
* occasions it might be computationally more convenient to model different
* countries within the same region and differentiate them simply by
* creating ad hoc fuels and technologies for each of them.
set REGION;
alias (r,REGION,rr);

* SEASON / ls: It gives indication (by successive numerical values) of how
* many seasons (e.g. winter, intermediate, summer) are accounted for and
* in which order.  This set is needed if storage facilities are included
* in the model.
set SEASON;
alias (ls,SEASON,lsls);

* DAYTYPE / ld: It gives indication (by successive numerical values) of
* how many day types (e.g. workday, weekend) are accounted for and in
* which order.  This set is needed if storage facilities are included in
* the model.
set DAYTYPE;
alias (ld,DAYTYPE,ldld);

* DAILYTIMEBRACKET / lh: It gives indication (by successive numerical
* values) of how many parts the day is split into (e.g. night, morning,
* afternoon, evening) and in which order these parts are sorted.  This set
* is needed if storage facilities are included in the model.
set DAILYTIMEBRACKET;
alias (lh,DAILYTIMEBRACKET,lhlh);

* STORAGE / s: It includes storage facilities in the model.
set STORAGE;
alias (s,STORAGE);
